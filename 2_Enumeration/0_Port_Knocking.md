# Background
Sometimes there are services and ports open on the local host that we can't see or identify with the traditional nmap searching / scanning.  This is when we have to do port knocking to open up these hidden ports / services.

1. You can see this if you are on the local host.
```
netstat â€“alnp | grep LIST
```

The Knockd service establishes what port knocking sequence is necessary to "unlock" a hidden port to the outside.
1. You can identify if the knockd service is being used by the host by: 
```
Cd init.d; ls
```
2. See if knockd is in the list.
3. If it is in the list, the knock sequence is found in Knockd's default file for system configuration (generally in /etc/default/knockd).
4. If the ports listed in the sequence variable are knocked (sent a TCP packet) in the correct order, then a certain command is executed to open up a port.
```
for I in [port knock sequence like:1 2 3]; do nmap -Pn -p $I --host-timeout 201 --max-retries 0 [IP address]; done 
knock [IP address] [port knock squence like:1 2 3]
```
  - Knock is a small binary that is downloaded as part of the knockd package from apt.
5. Then you can nmap for the port to see it's open / unfiltered.
