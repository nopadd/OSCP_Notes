# Background
- Internet Realy Chat (IRC) that may be on other ports than this standard one.
- You access the service by setting up a username, nickname, and password upon interaction with it
- You generally just access it to understand the version number which will let you find any RCE vulnerabilities to get access to the server.
- Interacting with IRC's is based on RFC 1459.
