# Background \(Vulnhub:Mr.Robot\)

* Sometimes you encounter files with .dic at the end of them.  This means they are HUGE dictionary files.
* There's likely valuable content in these files as they are not that common on normal boxes but identifying what is valuable in all the data is an effort.
* You can quickly reduce the noise in these files through the following:

  ```text
  cat [original file] | sort | unique [output file name]
  ```

* You can then inspect this information.  It is likely this information will be used in a brute-force attack as the username or password would be hidden in the file text.
