# Background
- Remember binary vs. ASCII mode.  If you choose the wrong mode for the file type, it will become corrupted. 
  - Binary: To upload a binary file type to an FTP server, you have to be in binary mode. 
  - ASCII: To upload a text file to an FTP server, you have to be in ASCII mode. 
- Permsisions of the FTP files follow normal conventions.  However, you can't read any files over FTP - just transfer between hosts.  The read permission of your authenticated user/group determines if you can transfer a file or not.
- The UID and GID are in the middle of the direcotry display and correspond to the passwd and group file ID's (0 = root).
