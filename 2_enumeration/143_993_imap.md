* IMAP lets you access email stored on that server. 
* The emails you receive are not stored on your computer but on a specific mail-server. So every time you look in your inbox your email-client \(like outlook\) fetches the emails from the mail-server using imap. 
* IMAP is a lot like pop3. But with IMAP you can access your email from various devices. With pop3 you can only access them from one device. 
* Port 993 is the secure port for IMAP.
