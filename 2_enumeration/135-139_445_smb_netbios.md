# 135-139\_445\_SMB\_NetBIOS

## Background

* Server Message Block \(SMB\) for Windows OS that has a history of being insecure leakage of NetBIOS information over the years.  It is likely an enumeration vector for any Windows OS 7 or older. 
* The default OS using SMB is Windows, but there was a version ported over to Unix called Samba. 
* Lists all of the connected network resources for an individual host. 
* Version listing 
  * SMB1: Windows 2000, XP, 2003 
    * This was the version susceptible to eternal blue exploit.  
  * SMB2: Vista SP1, 2008 
  * SMB2.1: 7 and 2008 R2 
  * SMB3: 8 and Windows 2012 
* Listens on TCP port 139 and 445 but it also listens on a number of UDP ports too. 
* NetBIOS codes and suffixes 
  * For unique names: 

        - 00: Workstation Service \(workstation name\) 

        - 03: Windows Messenger service 

        - 06: Remote Access Service 

        - 20: File Service \(also called Host Record\) 

        - 21: Remote Access Service client 

        - 1B: Domain Master Browser – Primary Domain Controller for a domain 

        - 1D: Master Browser 

  * For group names: 

        - 00: Workstation Service \(workgroup/domain name\) 

        - 1C: Domain Controllers for a domain 

        - 1E: Browser Service Elections 
* Null Sessions 
  * Certain versions \(SMB1\) / configurations allow for null sessions which menas an unauthenticated NetBIOS session between 2 computers can be established over this service. 
  * This allows the connecting computer to dump large amounts of information \(password policies, usernames, group names, machine names, user and host SID's\).

## Manual Enumeration

### Initial enumeration

```text
nbtscan –r [IP]
```

* NetBIOS Name: Hostname of the computer

  ```text
  nmblookup -A [IP]
  ```

* This displays the NetBIOS names and prefixes for a specific IP of interest that you see from the nbtscan results.

### Enum4linux

* Enumerates a lot of services including SMB and attempts null session authentication to extract information. 

  ```text
  enum4linux -a [IP]
  ```

  **NMap NSE Scripts**

* Contained in /usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb location. 
* Useful ones include 'smb-vulns' and 'smb-os-discovery' 

  ```text
  nmap –p 135, 445 –script=[script name] [IP]
  ```

  ```text
  nmap --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-ls.nse,smb-enum-users.nse,smb-mbenum.nse,smb-os-discovery.nse,smb-security-mode.nse,smbv2-enabled.nse,smb-vuln-cve2009-3103.nse,smb-vuln-ms06-025.nse,smb-vuln-ms07-029.nse,smb-vuln-ms08-067.nse,smb-vuln-ms10-054.nse,smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse, smb-vuln-ms10-061.nse,smb-vuln-regsvc-dos.nse,smbv2-enabled.nse $IP -p 445
  ```

### SMBMAP

* SMBMap allows users to enumerate samba share drives across an entire domain. List share drives, drive permissions, share contents, upload/download functionality, file name auto-download pattern matching, and even execute remote commands.  
* General enumeration of file shares:

  ```text
  Smbmap -H [IP] -R --depth [5]
  ```

* You can configure the recursive depth the command enumerates.

### RPCclient \(authentication required\)

* Allows for interaction with Windows machines from Unix boxes. 

  ```text
  rpcclient -U "[user name]" [IP]
  ```

  * Can do a null session with username of "" and -N option. 

    **Commands to enter once authenticated:**

* srvinfo 
* enumdomusers 
* getdompwinfo 
* querydominfo
* netshareenum 
* netshareenumall 

  ```text
  smbclient -L //[IP]
  ```

  ```text
  Queryuser [userid]
  ```

### Null Session

#### Windows

```text
>net use \\[IP]\[smb share drive name we have access to] "" /u:""  
>net view \\[IP]
```

#### Linux

* See SMBClient commands below. 

### Smbclient

* Client that can ‘talk’ to an SMB/CIFS server. It offers an interface similar to that of the FTP program. Operations include things like getting files from the server to the local machine, putting files from the local machine to the server, retrieving directory information from the server and so on.

  ```text
  smbclient -L //[IP]
  ```

  ```text
  smbclient //[IP]/[smb share drive name we have access to] -U [user name]
  ```

  * Sometimes anonymous logins are allowed, which is a –U "" syntax.
  * Sometimes logins aren't even enabled, which excludes the usage of the -U option.

### Enumerate RID's

#### Metasploit

```text
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_lookupsid
```

#### Python

```text
python /usr/share/doc/python-impacket-doc/examples 
/samrdump.py [IP]
```

#### RIDEnum

```text
ridenum.py [IP] 500 50000 dict.txt
```
