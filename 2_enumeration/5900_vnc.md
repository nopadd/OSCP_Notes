# 5900\_VNC

## Background

* VNC is used to get a screen from a remote host. 
* Authentication: You do not have to set up a username for authentication.  However, if authentication is set up, then the username and password to log into the VNC service are separate from the OS username and PW \(dumped hashes from SAM won't give you access to VNC\).
* VNC Service runs as a specific user of the OS, though.
* If this service has authentication enabled, you need to obtain the secret file which acts likes the password for authentication.
