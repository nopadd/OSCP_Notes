* Internet Realy Chat \(IRC\) that may be on other ports than this standard one.
* You access the service by setting up a username, nickname, and password upon interaction with it
* You generally just access it to understand the version number which will let you find any RCE vulnerabilities to get access to the server.
* Interacting with IRC's is based on RFC 1459.
