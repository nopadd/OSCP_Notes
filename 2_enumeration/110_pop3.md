# 110\_POP3

## Background

* This service is used for fetching emails on a email server. 
* So the server that has this port open is probably an email-server, and other clients on the network \(or outside\) access this server to fetch their emails.  
  * You need email credentials to interact with it and fetch emails.
* If this port with other mail-type ports are open \(25, 110, 119\) - then we can likely run a local mail client to interact with these services more natively.
