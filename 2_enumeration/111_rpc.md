# 111\_RPC

## Background

* Remote Procedural Call \(RPC\) is a service that allows other computers to call on the host computer for some operation when executing a script or commands automatically.
* The existence of this port / service running usually indicates that there are other ports open on the machine \(generally high-level ones running on non-standard ports\).  You should do a full nmap scan of all ports if you see these other ports and services on the machine for further enumeration.
* This can help look for Network File System \(NFS\) shares - usually running on [2049](https://github.com/neogeo56/OSCP_Notes/blob/master/Enumeration/2049_NFS.md)
* You can generally only use this port for further enumeration of what other ports and services are open.  No exploitation is generally available with this port.

## Manual Enumeration

Obtain a list of services running with RPC Bind.

```text
rpcbind -p [IP]
```

```text
rpcinfo -p [IP]
