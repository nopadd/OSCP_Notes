# General

If we get random images on a web page, we can check if they are hiding anything with stegnography.

## Binwalk \(ippsec:Nineveh\)

1. Download the image to the local host. 
2. Use binwalk to identify if there are any signs of zipped files, compressed data, or archives.  If these exist, the image likely has stegonography.

   ```text
   binwalk [image file]
   ```

3. Extract any files from the image and re-run binwalk on what is extracted.  These files are extracted to the PWD of the local host.

   ```text
   binwalk â€“Me [file]
   ```

## Steghide

* Can remove the stegonography of an image if you have a password.

  ```text
  apt-install steghide
  ```

  ```text
  steghide extract -sf [image file location] -p [password]
  ```
