## Machine Summaries

### 1X10 Pointer

* This is easy boot to root machine.
* There will be a lot of ports open similar to Metasploitable but look for the unique service in a unique port.

### 2X20 Pointers

* Similar to HTB machines like October, Popcorn, Shocker, Beep.

### 2X25 Pointers

* One is BOF.  Practice on SLMAIL, FreeFloat FTP, and Brainpan.
* One is slightly harder machine filled with rabbit holes.  Similar to Giddy / Jeeves.

## Metasploit

* Manage the use of it.
* After moving on from the 25 pointer rabbit hole, I was able to pwn one of the 20 point boxes without Metasploit.
* I then moved to the other 20 pointer and tried all the possible non Metasploit options. No dice.
* So I checked out the 10 pointer to make sure Metasploit is not required. 10 mins later, pwned without Metasploit.
* So I can now use Metasploit on the other 20 pointer.
