# Background
- Enumeration of this port should have identified what services are available to you on the target host if you navigate to the target host through this proxy port.

# Exploit (Vulnhub: Skytower)
1. To interact with and exploit any additional target ports and services available on the host through the proxy, you have to add the proxy to your local proxychains file.  First enter edit mode in the file.
```
vim /etc/proxychains.conf
```
2. Go down to the bottom of the file and clear out any other proxychains lines that are uncommented as they will interrupt what we're trying to do.
3. Enter in an uncommented line at the bottom to establish a proxy with this proxy service to the target host.  This is assuming that the proxy on port 3128 is HTTP.
```
http [Target IP] [port like 3128]
```
4. You can interact with any of the additional services and ports on the target by prepending 'proxychains' to your CLI.  For example, if SSH is only available to you on the target if you navigate through the proxy.
```
proxychains ssh [user]@[IP]
```
