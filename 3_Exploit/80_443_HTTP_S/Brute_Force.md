# Brute Force Login Screens
- Generally doesn't work but should be tried anyways in case it's low hanging fruit. 
- It is more likely to be successful if we already have some usernames that will likely work. 
- General usernames and passwords should also be tried but we can't have this list be too long because it will take time. 

1. Turn on proxy (Burp or ZAP) and capture requests. 
2. Attempt a general login. 
3. Look at the request being sent to identify the method (GET or POST) to send the authentication credentials as well as the variable name for the username and password.
4. See what keyword is displayed upon a failed login attempt.
5. Create or use a list of usernames to attempt brute force login. [Default Username List](https://github.com/neogeo56/OSCP/blob/master/Web/Brute_Force/Default-Usernames.txt)
6. Create or use a list of passwords to attempt brute force login. [Default Password List](https://github.com/neogeo56/OSCP/blob/master/Web/Brute_Force/rockyou-20.txt)
7. Create a colon-seperated file of username and password combinations using the [UserPass_List_Maker.py](https://github.com/neogeo56/OSCP/blob/master/Web/Brute_Force/UserPass_List_Maker.py)
```
python3 UserPass_List_Maker.py [user list] [password list]
```
- Creates the colon-seperated file "User_Pass.txt" in the directory the script was run from.
8. Brute force login screen with [Web_Brute_Force_2.py](https://github.com/neogeo56/OSCP/blob/master/Web/Brute_Force/Web_Brute_Force_2.py) python script.
```
python3 Web_Brute_Force_2.py -f/--file [colon seperated username:password file] -U/--URL [URL to the web application login form] -k/--keyword [Keyword in the HTML used to identify failed login attempts] -uP [HTTP parameter that passes the username] -pP [HTTP parameter that passes the password] -o [outfile location]
```
