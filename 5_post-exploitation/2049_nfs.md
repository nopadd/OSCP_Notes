# Examine Configuration Files

* /etc/exports \(Vulnhub:Vulnix\)
  * This file lists the files on the target box that are allowed to be shared through NFS.
  * If possible \(through sudo or sudoedit\), we can add the /root directory to this file, give it a \* access and privleges of \(rw,no\_root\_squash\).  Then we can mount it \(using the enumeration steps for this port\) and add an .ssh key to the root directory to SSH in and have root access.
* /etc/lib/nfs/xtab
