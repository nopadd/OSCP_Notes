# 21\_FTP

## Background

* Remember binary vs. ASCII mode.  If you choose the wrong mode for the file type, it will become corrupted. 
  * Binary: To upload a binary file type to an FTP server, you have to be in binary mode. 
  * ASCII: To upload a text file to an FTP server, you have to be in ASCII mode. 
* Permsisions of the FTP files follow normal conventions.  However, you can't read any files over FTP - just transfer between hosts.  The read permission of your authenticated user/group determines if you can transfer a file or not.
* The UID and GID are in the middle of the direcotry display and correspond to the passwd and group file ID's \(0 = root\).
