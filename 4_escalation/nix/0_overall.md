## General Recommendations

* Basic system info \(OS/Kernel/System name, etc\) 
* Networking Info \(ifconfig, route, netstat, etc\) 
* Miscellaneous filesystem info \(mount, fstab, cron jobs, etc\) 
* User info \(current user, all users, super users, command history, etc\) 
* File and Directory permissions \(world-writeable files/dirs, suid files, root home directory\) 
* Files containing plaintext passwords  
* Interesting files, processes and applications \(all processes and packages, all processes run by root and the associated packages, sudo version, apache config file, etc\)
* All installed languages and tools \(gcc, perl, python, nmap, netcat, wget, ftp, etc\)

## Exam Tip

Remember, they want you use a specific technique. Enumerate and run this:

```text
which awk perl python ruby gcc cc vi vim nmap find netcat nc wget tftp ftp 2>/dev/null
```

This will give you a good idea of what language the priv esc is typically using. If you don’t see a compiler such as GCC, you know it’s probably not going to be a kernel exploit.
