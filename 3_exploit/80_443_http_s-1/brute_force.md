# Brute Force Login Screens

* Generally doesn't work but should be tried anyways in case it's low hanging fruit. 
* It is more likely to be successful if we already have some usernames that will likely work. 
* General usernames and passwords should also be tried but we can't have this list be too long because it will take time.
* Turn on proxy \(Burp or ZAP\) and capture requests.
* Attempt a general login. 
* Look at the request being sent to identify the method \(GET or POST\) to send the authentication credentials as well as the variable name for the username and password.
* See what keyword is displayed upon a failed login attempt.
* Create or use a list of usernames to attempt brute force login. [Default Username List](https://github.com/neogeo56/OSCP/blob/master/Web/Brute_Force/Default-Usernames.txt)
* Create or use a list of passwords to attempt brute force login. [Default Password List](https://github.com/neogeo56/OSCP/blob/master/Web/Brute_Force/rockyou-20.txt)
* Create a colon-seperated file of username and password combinations using the [UserPass\_List\_Maker.py](https://github.com/neogeo56/OSCP/blob/master/Web/Brute_Force/UserPass_List_Maker.py)

  ```text
  python3 UserPass_List_Maker.py [user list] [password list]
  ```

* Creates the colon-seperated file "User\_Pass.txt" in the directory the script was run from.
* Brute force login screen with [Web\_Brute\_Force\_2.py](https://github.com/neogeo56/OSCP/blob/master/Web/Brute_Force/Web_Brute_Force_2.py) python script.

  ```text
  python3 Web_Brute_Force_2.py -f/--file [colon seperated username:password file] -U/--URL [URL to the web application login form] -k/--keyword [Keyword in the HTML used to identify failed login attempts] -uP [HTTP parameter that passes the username] -pP [HTTP parameter that passes the password] -o [outfile location]
  ```
