# 22\_SSH

## Background

* If you are unable to access SSH through brute-forcing attempts, then you need to come back once you have confirmed credentials.

## Exploit

### Password Guessing

```text
ssh [username]@[IP]
```

### Password Brute Force

```text
hydra -s [22] -L [username list] -P [password list] [IP] [ssh] -e [ns] -w [5] -W [1] -vV
```

### Error Handling \(ippsec:Sunday\)

* Occasionally you could encounter an error where the key exchange algorithm that is supported by the target is an older version of SSH that isn't in the default list of the SSH client on our attacker box.
* If this happens, we just need to add one of the older key exchange algorithms to our attacker box supported versions with the â€“okexAlgorithms=+\[algorithm name\].
  * The algorithm name is one of the options displayed when we try to use our standard SSH client to access the target box.  You can just pick one from the error message list.
* Note: Hydra doesn't support usage of older key exchange algorithms.  If this happens, and we still want to brute force - we can use the tool patator.
